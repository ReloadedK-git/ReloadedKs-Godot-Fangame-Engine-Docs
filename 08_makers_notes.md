# Maker's notes

Learning a new engine is difficult. You will have to dedicate a certain amount of time until you feel comfortable enough to understand many of the things provided in this project, there's no way around it. I bounced back on at least 3 occasions, before even Godot 4.0 came out. There were a couple fangame engines already made for v3.x, but I found all of them to be too complex or difficult to understand, even with comments, which turned me away from the idea of exploring this new game engine. It was when Godot 4.0 released that I made the decision to take the time to understand how it really worked, and forced myself to learn GDScript for some time, with varied success.

Truth be told, the main goal of this project was to learn how Godot works, and while I'm still far from done, I put lots of passion and effort into both the fangame engine and its documentation. Perhaps the combination of these 2 will be what someone needs in order to start trying Godot. I believe exploring new possibilities is always worth the time, even if you don't succeed the first, second or third time.

Part of the fun of this project is that there's no "correct" way of making fangame engines in Godot. When it comes to Game Maker, getting compared to other engines is inevitable, since they have been there from the very start, but that's not quite the case here. There's a certain charm it that, I suppose. All in all, fangames exist as a way to help us create new things, regardless of the tools we use.

I'll suggest learning the basics by making small, simple projects. It's the one thing that stuck with me, and perhaps it will work with you as well. You can watch some youtube videos and use them as a learning source:
